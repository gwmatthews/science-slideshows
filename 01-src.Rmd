]

.right-list[

- One of the founders of Western philosophy, Socrates spent his life encouraging others to critically examine their fundamental values and assumptions.

- He was executed on charges of "corrupting the youth."

### *Philosophy and skepticism*

*Philo-sophia*: "the love of wisdom"
 
- Philosophy seeks understanding of the nature of reality and the significance of our lives by critically questioning our **deepest and most general beliefs**.

- It draws out basic assumptions, asking questions with **the wonder of a child**.

- It subjects all ideas and claims to careful analysis with **the precision of a lawyer**.

![:vspace 30]()

.question[

If everything is open to question how can we know anything at all?

Is **wisdom** just knowing how little you know?

.narrow-text[
.question[

How can we even tell?

Should we be skeptical of the claim that they have or not?

What is the difference between philosophical and scientific skepticism?

]

### *Organized skepticism*

.example[.red[Science keeps skepticism contained with:]

- **Rejection of global doubts**: don't have such an open mind that your brains fall out.

- **Reliance on public evidence:** many eyes make all problems easy.

- **Trusting strength in numbers:** if it can't be repeated it can't be trusted.

- **Structured testing:** make risky predictions and be willing to admit failure.

- **Resistance to theory:** let the the big picture emerge on its own.]

## *The philosopher's toolkit*

---

.caution[
Since philosophy asks us to examine *all* of our assumptions, there can be no fixed method for doing philosophy - historically speaking there have been many different approaches.
]

Over time, however, certain useful principles have been developed.

- Explicitly state our .red[assumptions] -- this can be a challenge since they *are* assumptions after all.

- Draw out their logical .red[implications] -- do these assumptions fit well with each other and do they clash with other ideas we have?

- Make lots of .red[distinctions]. (Philosophers have a bad reputation for "splitting hairs," but we think it is important to be precise in our use of language.)
