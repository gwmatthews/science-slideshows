Why did people find Socrates' questions so threatening that they killed an old man who would likely soon pass away anyway?

### *philo-sophia*

---

--

The word "philosophy" comes from the Greek words for "love" (*philos*) and "wisdom" (*sophia*) and might be literally translated as "the love or pursuit of wisdom."

--
 
- Philosophy seeks understanding of the nature of reality and the significance of our lives by applying critical reasoning to our deepest and most general beliefs.

--

- It draws out basic assumptions, by asking questions with all of the wonder of a child.

--

- And it subjects them to careful analysis with all of the precision of a lawyer.

--

.question[

What is the difference between wisdom and knowledge? Can one know things without being wise or the other way around?

]

---

.caution[

.red[Science] also seeks to understand reality, but it differs from philosophy in its method of evaluating its claims.

]

<br>

--

- If you are wrong in science your predictions fail, or you accidentally blow up the lab.

--

- If you are wrong in philosophy, your principles and most general beliefs conflict with each other and so your mind is at odds with itself.

--

- Failure to clarify one's life philosophically may seem unimportant, yet for Socrates not doing so is to lead an "unexamined life" and miss out on what is most valuable and unique about being human.

---

.caution[

.red[Religion] addresses the significance of our lives, but it differs from philosophy in how it proceeds.

]

<br>

--

- Religion emerges from the spontaneous ways we make meaning in our lives. It often embraces mythical and magical thinking, which place us at the center of life's drama.

--

- Philosophy seeks clarification and justification and asks how we might find meaning, even in a world where we are not at the center of things.

--

- Philosophy is fundamentally "humanistic" since it trusts our ability to figure things out, while religion often appeals to faith, emphasizing the limits of our ability to comprehend things.

## *The philosopher's toolkit*

---

--

.caution[
Since philosophy asks us to examine *all* of our assumptions, there can be no fixed method for doing philosophy - historically speaking there have been many different approaches.
]

--

Over time, however, certain useful principles have been developed.

--

- Explicitly state our assumptions -- this can be a challenge since they *are* assumptions after all.

--

- Draw out their logical implications -- do these assumptions fit well with each other and do they clash with other ideas we have?

--

- Make lots of distinctions. (Philosophers have a bad reputation for "splitting hairs," but we think it is important to be precise in our use of language.)
