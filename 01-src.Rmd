.middletext[

.left-blurb[

"The unexamined life is not worth living."

]
]

.right-list[

- One of the founders of Western philosophy, Socrates spent his life encouraging others to critically examine their fundamental values and assumptions.

]

.right-list[

- He was executed for "corrupting the youth."

]

.right-list[

.question[

Why did people find Socrates' questions so threatening that they killed an old man who would likely soon pass away anyway?

]

]
---

"The love of (*philos*) wisdom (*sophia*)"
 
- Seeks understanding of the nature of reality and the significance of our lives by critical examination of our **deepest and most general beliefs**.

- Draws out basic assumptions, asking questions with **the wonder of a child**.

- Subjects them to careful analysis with **the precision of a lawyer**.

![:vspace 30]()

.question[

What is the difference between wisdom and knowledge? Can one know things without being wise or the other way around?

]

---

.caution[

.red[Science] also seeks to understand reality, but it differs from philosophy in its method of evaluating its claims.

]

<br>

- If you are wrong in science **your predictions fail**, or you accidentally blow up the lab.

- If you are wrong in philosophy, **your principles and most general beliefs conflict with each other** and so your mind is at odds with itself.

- Failure to clarify one's life philosophically is to lead an "unexamined life." 

---

.caution[

.red[Religion] addresses the significance of our lives, but it differs from philosophy in how it proceeds.

]

<br>

- Religion emerges from the spontaneous ways we make meaning in our lives, placing us at the center of life's drama.

- Philosophy seeks clarification and justification and asks how we might find meaning, even in a world where we are not at the center of things.

- Philosophy trusts our ability to figure things out, while religion often appeals to faith and human limitations.

"How should I live my life? In pursuit of power and money or in pursuit of wisdom?" 

]

]

.right-list[

- This is not a question about how we do in fact live but of how we *should* live.

]

- Such *normative* questions challenge us to give an account of ourselves, our values and our assumptions.

]

.right-list[

- Socrates' question is a question in the sub-field of philosophy called .red[value theory] or .red[axiology].

"What can I know with any degree of certainty, when my senses so often mislead me?"

]

]

.right-list[

- Descartes asked this question at the beginning of the Scientific Revolution when old "certainties" were revealed to be based on false assumptions.

]

]

]

]

.right-list[

]

- What *is* the relationship between minds and brains, and can we build an artificial brain that actually has a mind?

- How does order arise in the universe and what is the role of chance in the way things are?

- Are purposes built-in to things or imposed on them by us?

## *The philosopher's toolkit*

---

.caution[
Since philosophy asks us to examine *all* of our assumptions, there can be no fixed method for doing philosophy - historically speaking there have been many different approaches.
]

Over time, however, certain useful principles have been developed.

- Explicitly state our .red[assumptions] -- this can be a challenge since they *are* assumptions after all.

- Draw out their logical .red[implications] -- do these assumptions fit well with each other and do they clash with other ideas we have?

- Make lots of .red[distinctions]. (Philosophers have a bad reputation for "splitting hairs," but we think it is important to be precise in our use of language.)
