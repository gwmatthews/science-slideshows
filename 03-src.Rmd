### *Approaches to magical thinking*

.example[

**_Embrace it:_**
  - "The world just is full of magic!"

**_Dismiss it:_**
  - "It's nonsense, who are you kidding?"

**_Tolerate it:_**
- "It might work for you even if it doesn't work for me."

**_Try to explain it:_**
- "It shows us something about how the mind works."
]

### *Elements of magical thinking*

.example[

**_Essentialism_**

- Certain things have a fixed inner nature that explains what they do.

![:vspace 5]

**_Words and thoughts have power_**

- Language, thoughts and symbols can make stuff happen in the world directly.

![:vspace 5]

**_Agents are everywhere_**

- Disembodied spirits, ghosts, divine minds, etc. are always watching and might do things at any moment.
]

---

### *Essentialism*


.argument[
- Some things have essential, permanent features built-in to them.

- These "essences" determine how things behave, and what their "natural place" in the order of things is and should be.

- It is *wrong* to treat things differently than what their essence demands.
]

![:vspace 30]

.question[

Is this a side-effect of our capacity to categorize things and form concepts?

]

---

### *Words and thoughts have power*

.argument[
- Words, symbols and thoughts can have a direct influence on events in the real world.

- Words and thoughts can evoke the dead, cause good or bad things to happen, counteract or enhance the effects of other words.

- Symbols and symbolic objects can influence events from a distance.
]

![:vspace 30]

.question[

Is this a result of our taking literally the power of language and symbolism to suggest and evoke ideas?

]

---

### *Agents are everywhere*

.argument[
- There are hidden beings with minds all over the place.

- Nothing happens by chance and everything happens for a reason.

- Hidden agents create and maintain order, administer justice, help or hinder our plans.
]

![:vspace 30]

.question[

Is this a side-effect of our hyper-developed social minds, coupled with a bias towards paranoia?
