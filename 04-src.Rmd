### *The Medieval World View*

.pull-left[

![:scale 90%, #ccc](img/04/dantes-world.jpg)

]

.pull-right[

The universe is split in two:

- heaven and earth
- mind and matter
- humans and animals
- saints and sinners
- perfection and imperfection

Human life plays out on center stage between heaven and earth and everything else revolves around this drama.
