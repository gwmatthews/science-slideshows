### *Theories of knowledge*

--

.topcap[rationalism]

- Mind deduces the basic nature of things from fundamental concepts; knowledge results from thinking things through carefully.

--

![:vspace 20]()

.topcap[empiricism]

- Mind passively recieves information from outside; knowledge requires dropping pre-concieved ideas about what things are like and letting the data speak for itself. 

--

![:vspace 20]()

.topcap[constructivism]

- Mind organizes raw data into a coherent picture of reality, so knowledge involves building models and testing them against new information.

.question[

If the world that we experience is a mental construct, how does this affect our ability to know what things are really like?

### Completing the picture

.wide-list[
*Why does the color of the intersections change depending on whether you are looking straight at them or not?*
]

---

.wide-list[
- Our minds are "anticipation engines" -- we identify patterns and use them to anticipate what happens next in time, space or action.
]

--

.wide-list[
- By default we leap to conclusions only later filtering them through critical thinking.
]

--

.wide-list[
- The ease with which we can connect the dots enables us to thrive in complex and novel environments.

.wide-list[
- It also leaves us vulnerable to seeing patterns that aren't really there.
