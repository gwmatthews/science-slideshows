## *the scientific method*

![:vspace 20]()

--

- Make lots of careful observations.

--

- Look for apparent patterns in the observations.

--

- Take a guess at an explanation for those patterns.

--

- Deduce consequences of your explanations.

--

- Test to see if those appear.

--

- Repeat with more observations, other explanations, new consequences, adjusting as consequences fail to appear.
