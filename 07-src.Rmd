### *Accomplishments of the Scientific Revolution*

---

![:scale 60%, #ccc](img/07/galileo-inclined-plane.jpg)

- Development of experimental methods -- formulation and testing of empirical hypotheses.

---

![:scale 50%, #ccc](img/07/gravitation.jpg)

- A comprehensive mathematical model of mechanical and gravitational motion.

---

![:scale 80%, #ccc](img/07/colbert-louis.jpg)

- Establishment of scientific societies devoted to the development and publication of scientific findings.

---

![:scale 90%, #ccc](img/07/humboldt.jpg)

- A growing body of observational data in many areas as Europeans colonized and explored the rest of the world.

### *Unknowns in 1800*

---

![:scale 80%, #ccc](img/07/four-elements.jpg)

- What are material things made of?

---

![:scale 80%, #ccc](img/07/alchemy.jpg)

- How do chemical reactions work?

---

![:scale 80%, #ccc](img/07/franklin.jpg)

- What is electricity?

---

![:scale 80%, #ccc](img/07/compass.jpg)

- What is magnetism?

---

![:scale 80%, #ccc](img/07/frans_snyders_market.jpg)

- What is the difference between animate and inanimate things?

---

![:scale 80%, #ccc](img/07/heat.jpg)

- What is heat and why does it make some processes happen faster?

These questions would all be answered in the 19th Century with the development of scientific understanding of the material world.

### *Connections*

- Energy is the ability to do work or make things happen.

- It comes in many forms: mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical all of which can be converted into each other.

- Electricty is moving electrons, and can be generated chemically and mechanically.

- Heat is the average kinetic energy of moving bits of matter.

- Chemical reactions involve sharing or exchange of electrically charged particles.

- Biological cells are biochemical machines that take into energy, grow reproduce and move themselves.
